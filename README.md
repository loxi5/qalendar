> [!NOTE]
> Qalendar now has a younger cooler sibling: [Schedule-X](https://github.com/schedule-x/schedule-x). It solves a lot of problems that Qalendar does not and won't solve. This also means there is currently no active development of this library apart from occasional bugfixes and dependency-updates.
